### Initial Release is a go

Since the last candidate:

- Games have been migrated, and various small enhancements were made to support them (#30)
- Search is now open for all, and issue #41 was repurposed to potentially work towards a different privacy solution in the future
- Rejoining now properly checks if you were finished with the round or not (#68)

There's always more to be done, but I'm pretty confident in everything working, and the things not working being tucked away
This is ready to go, and I'm calling this the real 1.0.0
