## Official branch support

You can now easily switch between beta and stable versions of the game! When you click the "Switch to beta" or "Switch to stable" button, you will be redirected to the appropriate site with all of your settings and game progress carried over. If there are features you would like to use that are not 'stable' yet, you can try them out on beta, and leave feedback to fix issues and get the feature you want.

The stable branch is everything that has been vetted as working in real gameplay scenarios, and can generally be relied on to work.

The beta or features branch has up and coming features included. These features are not-fully battle-tested, but are still verified to be working in clean one-person tests.
